### Machine learning projects
#### Implemented different machine learning techniques
##### Such as: regression tasks, classification tasks, and clustering.
### For file fatih_usta_1 (Prediction of car prices)
##### In this project, data contains information about different cars and their prices. Objective is to build a model that predicts car prices based on features.
##### Steps of handling the project:
##### 1) Data Preparation:
        a) Handling the missing values
        b) One hot encoding
        c) Standard scaling
##### 2) Data Exploring & Visualization:
        a) Understanding feature correlations and visualizing them
        b) Calculating correlations
##### 3) Linear Regression to predict prices:
        a) Linear Regression
        b) Polynomial Regression
        c) Lasso Regression
        d) Support Vector Regression with Grid Search to find best parameters
   
   
   
### For file fatih_usta_2 (Image Classification)
##### In this project, data contains information about different images of clothes. Objective is to build a model that predicts clothes based on features.
##### Steps of handling the project:
##### 1) Data Preparation:
        a) Binary transformation of each clothe. (10 different)
##### 2) Binary Classification:
        a) Logistic Regression
        b) Model evaluation: looking at accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall and f1 score.
        c) Plotting of ROC curve, AUC and learning curves.
##### 3) Multiclass Classification:
        a) Support Vector Classification with Grid Search
        b) Decision Trees with Grid Search
